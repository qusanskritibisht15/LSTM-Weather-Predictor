# LSTM-Weather-Predictor
This project forecasts temperature using historical weather data with an Long Short-Term Memory LSTM-based deep learning model.The dataset for time-series weather forecasting includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. After normalization and training, the model predicts future temperature trends and visualizes actual temperature; forecasted results showcasing neural network-based time series prediction.
Technical Overview
